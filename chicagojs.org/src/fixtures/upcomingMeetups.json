            "description": "<p>## Talk description</p> <p>At a glance, React and Vue are like two peas in a pod. They are lightweight component-based libraries for building user interfaces and can be used fairly interchangeably to build scalable web applications. Though they are noticeably different in terms of syntax, their key differences lie in their respective ways of thinking. As a React developer learning Vue, adapting to the “Vue way of doing things” is a challenge that requires a sound understanding of the philosophy behind Vue. In this talk, we will examine the nuances between the two frameworks and cover common mistakes that React developers make when switching from React to Vue.</p> <p>## About the speaker</p> <p>Divya is a web developer who is passionate about open source and good documentation. She most recently made the switch from React to Vue and has slowly but surely grown to enjoy the Vue. You will most likely find her in the sunniest spot in the room with a cup of tea in hand and puns on hand.</p> ",

Every month there are multiple React events, and we want to connect our members to different perspectives from different companies and experts in the React community.</p> <p>We are incredibly excited about joining our events!! We will share what is happening in Chicago and learn more about the Milwaukee scene without having to find parking!</p> <p>Each group will present via a webcast to the other group along with the ability to ask questions to the speakers. Milwaukee and Chicago will host their events as regularly scheduled with networking, swag, food, and beverages. Although this time there is the bonus of hearing from new speakers, different companies, unique perspectives and making new connections in a different city.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>5:30 Registration, beer, wine &amp; local food</p> <p>6:00 React JS Milwaukee Presents: Providing Context Around the Context API</p> <p>Presented by: AJ Zozakiewcz &amp; Ruben Manrique</p> <p>Description: Introduced with React 16.3, the Context API gives us another way to manage data. Context allows us to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.</p> <p>In this talk, we will try to provide some “context” around what it is and how to use it. We will go over some real-world use cases, dos and don’ts, and examples of how we are starting to take advantage of this feature at Northwestern Mutual.</p> <p>6:30 React Chicago Presents: Offline access with React Native + Redux</p> <p>Speaker: Tyson Kunovsky</p> <p>Description: This talk is focused on creating solid user experiences for offline access in React Native apps. In order to do this, we will take a look at libraries like redux-persist and react-native-offline, and will even hook up redux-form to persist form values.</p> <p>7:00 Networking - We will try to virtually mingle as well as our regularly scheduled networking</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Meet our speakers!</p> <p>Tyson Kunovsky</p> <p>Bio: Originally from South Africa, Tyson is a passionate full-stack engineer who manages the tech team over at Inspire11 consulting.

These concepts will help you to think differently and will make you a smarter React Developer.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>Talk-2:: Twice Around the JS Loop by Josh Beckman (45min)</p> <p>Description: Your code probably has promises, setTimeouts, setImmediates, requestAnimationFrames, style updates, process.nextTicks, etc. Do you have some bugs that pop up when those sequences happen out of order? Wouldn’t it be great to understand what governs the order of all those events?</p> <p>This talk explains and demystifies JavaScript's event loop, the thing that orchestrates the main thread of your browser, which includes JavaScript, events, and rendering. We'll look at the difference between tasks, micro tasks, paints, and where events land. We will also touch on the event loop in NodeJS, its subtle differences, and the considerations I/O brings to the loop on your server.<br/>By the end, you’ll be scheduling your async JavaScript code like a Pro!</p> ",
